## 1.0.0.9010
_date: "3/21/2018"_

* Identify outliers in MEAlagplot()
* 'GET' functions, e.g. getCCF, getMEA
* add a $rand object to _MEA_ class
* all functions accepting _MEAlist_ objects should accept a list instead and try to parse as _MEAlist_ internally
* Calculate % of simultaneous zeroes (when zeros are during at least 5s)
* Implement peak picking algorithms results in $ccfRes
* clean code: debug comments, italian comments, old commented code
* export long vector plots
* diagnostic plots with 2 rows, on the second showing random section in great detail, e.g. 10 s of nonempty signal
* add outlier removal to the readme example
* **smart** confidence interval analysis for bootstrap
* dynamic window size!!!
